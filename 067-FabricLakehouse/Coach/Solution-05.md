## Notes & Guidance

This challenge is about showing value to the customer and reflecting on the day. Although it might be tempting to drop this challenge (especially if time is tight), it's important to for the teams to present their work so please try to save reserve time to include this activity.

You will play the part of the customer. Make up a character (CDO, Dive SHop Manager, Salty old sea dog) and make it a fun retro. How's your pirate accent?

You might like to award small prizes for the best team, the best presentation, or the best pirate accent, but this challenge is not about winning or losing, it's about reflecting on the day and having fun. It's all about the bubbles we blew along the way.
