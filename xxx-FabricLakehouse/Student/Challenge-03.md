# Challenge 03 - Swab the Decks!

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-02.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-04.md)

## Introduction

You've found your data and have raw files sitting in OneLake. Now it's time to clean and combine your datasets ready for analysis.

Get Your Data Ship Shape!

## Description

In this challenge, you will develop a solution to prep your datasets ready for analysis. 

You may find gaps in your data, perhaps you need another dataset in order to blend and enrich your data. You may also need to clean your data, for example, remove duplicates or missing values, or convert data types, extract features and discard others.

Finally, you'll need to write the data into your Lakehouse.

## Success Criteria

To complete this challenge successfully, you should be able to:

- Show how you have cleaned and combined your datasets, and explain why you chose a particular method (eg a notebook, or a copy data activity)
- Demonstrate that your data is now ready to build your data story (This could be an exploratory dashboard, or a notebook, or even just some sample queries)

## Learning Resources

- [Use a notebook to load data into your Lakehouse](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/lakehouse-notebook-load-data)
- [Create your first dataflow to get and transform data](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-factory/create-first-dataflow-gen2)
- Power Query (as used in Dataflow2) has connectors for sources such as [XML](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/connectors/xml), [CSV](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/connectors/text-csv) and [JSON](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/connectors/json)
  
## Tips

- Sometimes Spark is the best tool for the job, but sometimes it's not.  Don't be afraid to use other tools in your solution.

## Too comfortable?  Eager to do more?  Try an additional challenge!

- You've probably guessed that the weather and water conditions are quite important to divers. Climate models are a great way to look at future predictions, and there are a number of open datasets available. Try adding a climate model to your data for both weather and wave conditions. (Hint: Microsoft Planetary Computer ECMWF))
